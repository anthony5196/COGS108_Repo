    "There are plenty of public datasets across the web that we can access including sources such as CBS, basketball-references, and ESPN. We can access statistics through these sources which would give us  points, assists, rebounds, steals, shooting percentages, etc...  and how they are distributed across different positions(point guard, shooting guard, center, power forward, guard). From this we can see how other variables such as minutes played, consecutive games played, age, and travel time can affect game performance. Weâ€™ll be using multiple seasons to have a large sample. To store and use the data we will use dataframe and pandas to utilize the already gathered data."
